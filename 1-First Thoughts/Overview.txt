Power : Same as original. Support for OG voltage regulator (or same footprint).

Composite Video : Composite goes into a 47k resistor and then into RCA, and AV trough jumper J1 (open for RGB).

RGB Video : RGB goes straight into AV. Sync goes into sync pin (Need to open J1), through a jumper for TTL/75 Ohm?

Switch Video : AV Pin 8 set to 12 V (AVmode). AV Pin 16 set to either 0 V (composite) or 1 V (RGB).

Audio : Goes through a buffer (op-amp) then into AV and RCA. Support for NESRGB's audio out? (Would need a jumper)


Other : Check how easy/difficult it is to remove old AVBox components without breaking anything. Take measurements.
