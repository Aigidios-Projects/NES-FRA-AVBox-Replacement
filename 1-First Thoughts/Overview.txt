Power : Same as original. Support for OG voltage regulator and/or new, less-heating model.

Composite Video : Composite goes into a 47k resistor and then into RCA, and AV trough jumper J1 (open for RGB).

RGB Video : RGB goes straight into AV. Sync goes into sync pin (Need to open J1), through a jumper for TTL/75 Ohm?

Switch Video : One set to 4:3. Other one set to either composite or RGB depending on what's connected (Needs a jumper?). Check needed voltages.

Audio : Goes through an amplifier? Then into AV and RCA. Support for NESRGB's audio out? (Needs a jumper)


Other : Check how easy/difficult it is to remove old AVBox components without breaking anything. Take measurements.
