# NES-FRA-AVBox-Replacement
My very first project as an electronics student, fairly simple in theory but that will allow me to practice some skills while having fun.

## What does the original AVBox do?
The AVBox of the NES has two purposes : provide power to the system, and output video and audio.
The video that the NES PPU outputs is composite, but because of french norms, Nintendo had to convert it to RGB. That conversion, made in the AVBox thanks to a Sony chip, sucks. It degrades the quality of the image by a lot.

## What does this replacement do?
The purpose of this replacement is to get rid of all the conversion part, to directly get the composite video to the AV port, while still powering the NES the same way the original AVBox did. But that's not all! It will also have a space for RCA connectors in case you'd want to use them, and it will allow you to connect the outputs of Tim Worthington's NESRGB, for true RGB quality out of the original NES AV port!

## Where is it?
Don't tell anyone, but it's not there yet, it's still a work-in-progress. When the PCB files (Gerbers) will be ready, i will update this README.
